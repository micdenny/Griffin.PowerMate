NOTICE

Project: Griffin.PowerMate (.NET Framework 4.8 Port / Reconstruction)

1. Origin
This codebase contains reconstructed (decompiled, refactored, and reorganized) source portions derived from the final publicly distributed Windows release of the Griffin Technology PowerMate software (reported version 2.0.1) after the product's discontinuation.

2. Copyright / Trademarks
- PowerMate and any related marks are the property of their respective rights holders (formerly Griffin Technology / Incipio or successors).
- No affiliation or endorsement is claimed.
- All original rights in the decompiled portions remain with the original rights holder. No license (open source or otherwise) to those portions is granted here beyond what is non-infringing under applicable law (e.g., limited reverse engineering for interoperability where permitted).

3. Scope of Rights
Unless and until a clean-room rewrite fully replaces a given file or component, that file SHOULD NOT be assumed to be under an open source license. Do not redistribute proprietary assets (icons, artwork, firmware, drivers) unless they are confirmed to be freely redistributable.

4. Newly Authored Code
Any newly authored, original code contributed to replace or extend functionality SHOULD include a file header clearly identifying:
// Copyright (c) <year> <author>
// Licensed under <intended license for original portions only>
Pending a full clean rewrite, no blanket repository-wide open source license applies.

5. Contributor Guidance
- Prefer incremental clean rewrites over expansion of decompiled code.
- Mark replaced files clearly when they become original implementations.
- Avoid copying assets or text from original binaries beyond what is necessary to achieve interoperability.

6. Takedown / Contact
If you are a rights holder and object to the presence of specific material, please open a repository issue requesting removal with sufficient detail to identify the material. Content will be reviewed and, if appropriate, removed or rewritten.

7. Disclaimer
Provided "as is" without warranty. Use is at your own risk. Jurisdictional laws regarding reverse engineering and decompilation vary; ensure your usage complies with local regulations.
